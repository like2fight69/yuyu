got it running with megaman sprite but have to use colors from palette 0
PAL0 is set in main line:65 and uses palette_all as the first palette
run powershell as adminastrator and ./in.ps1
clean objs in powershell
need to use reverse color on sprite
use by color select tool to replace color
have two colors for background palette rn. will add 13 more. program will crash when arrow buttons are pressed because there are no animations. need to add animations to sprite sheet
uses rgb.png for palettes now
